                        <h3>CONSTRUCTION SITE SECURITY</h3>
                        <p>Security officers are highly important to construction projects of any size. These sites most often contain fragile structures, complex designs, heavy machinery, and electrical hazards. Any tampering with these elements could have catastrophic consequences for the unauthorized individuals, the materials, and the company and workers who are building or developing the site. Delicate areas require monitoring and security to maintain structural integrity and to prevent vandalism, theft, or other bodily harm. A construction site security team from Sparta 3.8 Protection is the perfect service to ensure the safety and protection of both your construction site and anyone who may set foot on it. We are knowledgeable and highly trained to handle any security situation and are excited to begin surveilling your construction site. Security guard teams at construction sites have multi-faceted jobs. Construction sites must be constantly monitored, using a combination of physical security guards and an electronic system equipped with alarms and cameras to deter or catch trespassers. Site patrol, as well as remote patrol, allows the area to be watched at all times. Those who are on the site without permission or proper credentials can be immediately detected if using a construction site security team.</p>

                        <p>Some facilities do not require a 24/7 security service presence. In that case, the answer is often a security patrol that takes the time to patrol and sweep the entire grounds for unusual or suspicious activityâ€” even better are regular visits in a clearly-marked Sparta 3.8 Protection security vehicle to the patrol site for an interior and exterior inspection of the grounds. Your company can benefit from a cost savings over a 24/7 security presence.
                            Another cost saving measure is when we conduct interior inspections on your behalf of key machinery and equipment. You can train our officers to monitor equipment for signs of trouble and either call a key employee or make a settings adjustment. This saves you the expense of key equipment failing, potentially halting production.
